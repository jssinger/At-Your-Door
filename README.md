# AtYourDoor
AtYourDoor is a food delivery service for controlled access buildings!

## Problem
Controlled access apartment buildings offer a higher degree of privacy, safety, and serenity to their guests. Unfortunately, locking access makes food deliveries very inconvenient for the resident. AtYourDoor solves this problem by enabling the concierge, a trusted intermediary, to fulfill orders to the residents, allowing for both convenience and quiet.

## Process
When an order arrives at the building, the concierge will log the order into the website. The website will then send a text message to the resident notifying them that their order has been processed and is on its way. The concierge will then bring the order to the resident and fulfill the delivery. At the end of the month, each resident will be sent a bill for their AtYourDoor usage. Finally, the money is distributed proportionally to the concierges in accordance with the operating agreement that AtYourDoor signed with the concierge provided.  

## Results
The AtYourDoor system is currently demo testing at Domain College Park, in College Park, MD. The trial began in April 2022 and has processed over 215 orders in the past 5 weeks. After the 3 month trial period has concluded, AtYourDoor plans on expanding to more buildings in the DC/MD/VA area.
